# StaffPickVideos

### Important notes before proceeding
1. MainActivity is located at root of project for convenience.
> I refactored the project to outline MVVM architecture using Google's data binding (UI-heavy-logic all separated into ViewModels directory).
	Network layer and models all now in Models directory. Activities, views, adapters, etc. all located in Views directory. 




### Youâ€™ve inherited code...elevate it to your own standard of quality.

* A bug-free app that displays the Staff Picks list
	 > App is bug-free to the extent that it's been usability tested by myself and a friend.
* Architectural clarity
	 > MVVM using Google's data binding
* Software design that can scale
   > Object-oriented design to semantically separate classes, implement, extend, etc.
* Clear, functional, and responsive UI
	 > UI is easy to navigate and informational. Network state is observed with a library. 

### Using **one** 3rd party reactive library to observe network state. 

### Adding new features and functionality to the app is not necessary, but we appreciate...something extra. 
* Four Categories
  > User can not only view Staff Pick (Recent) videos, but also Premieres, best of Month, and best of Year.
	This was to mock Vimeo's web UX experience on the app; notice the 4 categories in this link:
  [Vimeo's staff picks](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks)
     
* Infinite Scrolling
  > Pagination for scrolling. As user scrolling reaches bottom of any list, more Videos will be 
  loaded to view (think scrolling newsfeed on Facebook app).
  
* Watch Videos
  > User can click on each Card (item in the list) to watch them in device browser.

* Uniqueness
  > Recent videos can also be best of the Month. I made sure videos can only appear in one list.

* Animation
  > Sliding animation while scrolling; progress spinner for loading.

* Design
  > Custom-made views and UI design. Immersive (full-screen) and pleasant viewing experience.
	
# Development Process
### Agile
  > Leverage my training in agile project management for the app.
  Three development iterations: Networking layer, Design, Refactoring/Documentation.
  
  Had a milestones and groomed product backlog, if you're curious, you can view it here:
  [milestone + backlog.pdf](https://github.com/iAutoparkCars/ETFQuery/files/1502666/milestone.backlog.pdf)




0. After understanding the problem, I immediately made wireframes to draft designs, 
   and even got feedback from a couple of friends. 
1. created my Vimeo app/client
2. Use Vimeo library to generate auth token, instead of generating developer's token (since it may expire after periods of no usage)
3. Convert async to Retrofit for performance, but after reading through Vimeo's android library, 
	saw that is uses Retrofit, so I learned how to authenticate and make GET requests with Vimeo's library.
		-- found some things in the library that I'd like to change
				--add an example for working authentication
				--give additional clarity in the GET request example. It's async
				--Video.getPlayCount() always returns null; maybe a bug. Several posts have been made on 
				SO and Vimeo developer's forum
				
4.  Make custom views to display four lists. The trick was to put the RecyclerView into a fragment, then
	this fragment as part of PageViewer, then connect PageViewer to a TabLayout to move between lists.
				

5. separated the download video/download images tasks into new classes 
	
	

	See if I can use Vimeo networking to get 
		0. if it works asynchronously 
		1. get the 4 [VideoList]s
		2. iterate through VideoList
		2. edit GET request by page, and per_page
