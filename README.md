### Vimeo Mobile & TV Apps Group
#### Android Coding Exercise

BogusCode is an app that fetches and displays the first page of videos in the [Vimeo Staff Picks channel](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints). However, the codebase and user experience are suboptimal to say the least.  

Youâ€™ve inherited BogusCode and your task is to elevate it to your own standard of quality. Correct all of the issues you see, refactor as you see fit, and make BogusCode clean, clear, performant and scalable. 

We're looking for the following in no particular order:

* A bug-free app that displays the Staff Picks list
* Architectural clarity
* Software design that can scale
* Clear, functional, and responsive UI

Please modify the BogusCode/README.md file included in the code with your returned submission to contain a brief summary of the issues you identified, the changes you made to correct them, and rationale behind those changes. Please also include a brief summary and explanation of any significant architectural changes you made.

You may use **ONLY ONE** third party library<sup>1</sup> to assist you with the completion of the task. It is not a requirement, but you can choose one if you wish. If you use a third party library, please provide a rationale in your BogusCode/README.md modification. Submissions that leverage more than one third party library will be disqualified. 

Adding new features and functionality to the app is not necessary, but we appreciate candidates who go a little further and add in something extra. That being said, we strongly suggest that you satisfy all of the requirements listed above before adding anything new.

Feel free to send us any questions that might arise along the way. 

**Good luck!**

<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;*As a clarification, the Android Support Library is not considered to be a third party library. Feel free to use one third party library in addition to the Android Support Library. As a final note, we strongly discourage copying and pasting blocks of code from any other sources. However, if you can make a strong case for using someone else's code, please comment thoroughly to show an understanding in addition to crediting the source and the rationale.*
